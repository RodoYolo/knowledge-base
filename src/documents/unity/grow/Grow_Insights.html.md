# Insights

## Overview

GROW Insights brings you priceless insights about your users at real-time and inside your code. You can use the provided insights to take actions on your users at real time during gameplay when your users actually arrive in your game. With Insights you can:  


- Create special prices for paying users in your genre.
- Adapt the game difficulty for the specific user.
- Create push campaigns.
- Adapt Ads to your specific users.
- A lot more ... you can create your own personalization features and even share them with others on the SOOMLA [Forums](http://answers.soom.la).

Currently, Insights supports PayInsights which categorizes users according to their pay-rank. More about this below.

## Integration

<div class="info-box">GROW Insights is included all GROW bundles: [GrowSpend](/unity/grow/GrowSpend_GettingStarted#SetupGrowSpend), [GrowViral](/unity/grow/GrowViral_GettingStarted#SetupGrowViral), [GrowCompete](/unity/grow/GrowCompete_GettingStarted#SetupGrowCompete), [GrowInsights](/unity/grow/GrowInsights_GettingStarted#SetupGrowInsights) and [GrowUltimate](/unity/grow/GrowUltimate_GettingStarted#SetupGrowUltimate) bundles. Please refer to the relevant bundle for initialization instructions.</div>


1. Initialize `GrowInsights` according to the instructions of your relevant bundle.

* Create event handler functions in order to be notified about (and handle) GROW Insights related events. See [Events](/unity/grow/Grow_Insights/#Events) for more information.

* Once initialized, GROW Insights will automatically retrieve relevant insights from the server. Once the insights are ready (see [`OnGrowInsightsRefreshFinished`](/unity/grow/Grow_Insights/#OnInsightsRefreshFinished)) you can access them as explained below.

## Events

Following is a list of all the events in GROW Insights and an example of how to observe & handle them.

This event is triggered when the GROW Insights feature is initialized and ready.

``` cs
HighwayEvents.OnGrowInsightsInitialized += onGrowInsightsInitialized;

public void onGrowInsightsInitialized() {
// ... your game specific implementation here ...
}
```

### OnInsightsRefreshStarted

This event is triggered when fetching insights from the server has started.

``` cs
HighwayEvents.OnInsightsRefreshStarted += onInsightsRefreshStarted;

public void onInsightsRefreshStarted() {
// ... your game specific implementation here ...
}
```

### OnInsightsRefreshFinished

This event is triggered when fetching insights from the server has finished.

``` cs
HighwayEvents.OnInsightsRefreshFinished += onInsightsRefreshFinished;

public void onInsightsRefreshFinished() {
// ... your game specific implementation here ...
}
```

### OnInsightsRefreshFailed

This event is triggered when fetching insights from the server has failed.

``` cs
HighwayEvents.OnInsightsRefreshFailed += onInsightsRefreshFailed;

public void onInsightsRefreshFailed() {
// ... your game specific implementation here ...
}
```
