# Gifting

## Overview

GROW Gifting brings you the tools to make your game go viral, by letting users send little surprises to one another. With GIFTING you can:  

- Send lives to your friend.
- Share rare items between friends to progress faster.
- Send coins to your loved one.
- A lot more ... you can create your own use cases and even share them with others on SOOMLA's [Forums](http://answers.soom.la).

## Integration

<div class="info-box">GROW Gifting is included in [GrowViral](/unity/grow/GrowViral_GettingStarted#SetupGrowViral) and [GrowUltimate](/unity/grow/GrowUltimate_GettingStarted#SetupGrowUltimate) bundles. Please refer to the relevant bundle for initialization instructions.</div>


1. Initialize `GrowGifting` according to the instructions of your relevant bundle.

2. Create event handler functions in order to be notified about (and handle) GROW Gifting related events. See [Events](/unity/grow/Grow_Gifting/#Events) for more information.

3. Once the user logs into any social provider, GROW Gifting will automatically start fetching gifts from the server. Once the gifts are ready (see [`OnGiftsRetrieveFinished`](/unity/grow/Grow_Gifting/#OnGiftsRetrieveFinished)) they will be handed out to the user as explained below.


## Events

Following is a list of all the events in GROW Gifting and an example of how to observe & handle them.

### OnGrowGiftingInitialized

This event is triggered when the GROW Gifting feature is initialized and ready.

``` cs
HighwayEvents.OnGrowGiftingInitialized += onGrowGiftingInitialized;

public void onGrowGiftingInitialized() {
// ... your game specific implementation here ...
}
```

### OnGiftsRetrieveStarted

This event is triggered when GIFTING starts fetching the user's gifts list (may be fired at any point in your application).

``` cs
HighwayEvents.OnGiftsRetrieveStarted += onGiftsRetrieveStarted;

public void onGiftsRetrieveStarted() {
// ... your game specific implementation here ...
}
```

### OnGiftsRetrieveFinished

This event is triggered when gifting finished fetching the player's gifts list (may be fired at any point in your application).
Provides a list of `Gift`s which will be handed out.
They will not be given to the player yet at this point (this is mainly to notify the player that gifts have arrived).

``` cs
HighwayEvents.OnGiftsRetrieveFinished += onGiftsRetrieveFinished;

public void onGiftsRetrieveFinished(IList<Gift> gifts) {
// ... your game specific implementation here ...
}
```

### OnGiftsRetrieveFailed

This event is triggered when fetching gifts fails (may be fired at any point in your application).
Provides the failure reason.

``` cs
HighwayEvents.OnGiftsRetrieveFailed += onGiftsRetrieveFailed;

public void onGiftsRetrieveFailed(string failReason) {
// ... your game specific implementation here ...
}
```

### OnGiftSendStarted

This event is triggered when a gift is about to be sent.
Provides the gift that is being sent.

``` cs
HighwayEvents.OnGiftSendStarted += onGiftSendStarted;

public void onGiftSendStarted(Gift gift) {
// ... your game specific implementation here ...
}
```

### OnGiftSendFinished

This event is triggered when a gift has been sent.
Provides the gift that was sent.

``` cs
HighwayEvents.OnGiftSendFinished += onGiftSendFinished;

public void onGiftSendFinished(Gift gift) {
// ... your game specific implementation here ...
}
```

### OnGiftSendFailed

This event is triggered when a gift failed to be sent.
Provides the gift that failed to be sent, and the failure reason.

``` cs
HighwayEvents.OnGiftSendFailed += onGiftSendFailed;

public void onGiftSendFailed(Gift gift, string failReason) {
// ... your game specific implementation here ...
}
```

### OnGiftHandOutSuccess

This event is triggered when a gift has been given to the player.
Provides the gift which was handed out to the user.

``` cs
HighwayEvents.OnGiftHandOutSuccess += onGiftHandOutSuccess;

public void onGiftHandOutSuccess(Gift gift) {
// ... your game specific implementation here ...
}
```

### OnGiftHandOutFailed

This event is triggered when a gift has failed to be given to the player.
Provides the gift which failed to be handed out to the user, and the failure reason.

``` cs
HighwayEvents.OnGiftHandOutFailed += onGiftHandOutFailed;

public void onGiftHandOutFailed(Gift gift, string failReason) {
// ... your game specific implementation here ...
}
```

## Main Classes & Methods

Let's go through the main classes of GROW Gifting. These classes contain functionality for gifting-related operations such as initializing and sending gifts.

### GrowGifting

`GrowGifting` is the main class of Gifting which is in charge of sending and fetching gifts.

#### Functions

**`Initialize()`**

Initializes the GROW Gifting feature. Once initialized, the `OnGrowGiftingInitialized` event is triggered.

**`SendGift(toProvider, toProfileId, itemId, amount, <optional>deductFromUser)`**

Sends a gift from the currently logged in user (with [Profile]()) to the provided user. This method gives the gift from the game without affecting the player.
Returns `false` if the operation cannot be started, `true` otherwise.
Params:

- toProvider - The social provider ID of the user to send gift to.
- toProfileId - The social provider user ID to send gift to.
- itemId - The virtual item ID to give as a gift.
- amount - The amount of virtual items to gift.
- deductFromUser (optional) - Should the virtual items be deducted from the player upon sending the gift.

The `OnGiftSendStarted` event is triggered once the sending process is started, and one of `OnGiftSendFinished` or `OnGiftSendFailed` is triggered depending on the operation outcome.

### Gift

`Gift` represents a gift from one user to the other.

#### Members

**`ID`**

The Gift's ID, only when received from server.

**`FromUID`**

User's UID from which the gift originated.

**`ToProvider`**

Social provider ID of the user to which the gift was sent.

**`ToProfileId`**

The receiving user's ID on the destination social provider

**`Payload`**

GiftPayload for the gift.

### GiftPayload

`GiftPayload` represents a gift payload which provides information of actual gift value.

#### Members

**`AssociatedItemId`**

The associated virtual item ID to give as a part of the gifting process.

**`ItemsAmount`**

The amount of the associated virtual item that should be given as a part of the gifting process.

### Example

Below is a short example of how to initialize GROW Gifting. We suggest you read about the different modules and their entities in SOOMLA's Knowledge Base: [STORE](/unity/store/Store_Model) and [PROFILE](/unity/profile/Profile_MainClasses).

### IStoreAssets

``` cs
public class ExampleAssets : IStoreAssets {

	/** Virtual Currencies **/
	public static VirtualCurrency COIN_CURRENCY = new VirtualCurrency(
	      "Coin currency",                  // Name
	      "Collect coins to buy items",     // Description
	      "currency_coin"                   // Item ID
	 );

    /** Virtual Currency Packs **/
    public static VirtualCurrencyPack TEN_COIN_PACK = new VirtualCurrencyPack(
        "10 Coins",                         // Name
	    "This is a 10-coin pack",           // Description
	    "coins_10",                         // Item ID
        10,                                 // Number of currencies in the pack
        "currency_coin",                    // The currency associated with this pack
        new PurchaseWithMarket(             // Purchase type
            TEN_COIN_PACK_PRODUCT_ID,       // Product ID
            0.99)                           // Initial price
    );

    /** Virtual Goods **/

    // Shield that can be purchased for 150 coins.
    public static VirtualGood SHIELD_GOOD = new SingleUseVG(
        "Shield",                           // Name
	    "Shields you from monsters",        // Description
	    "shield_good",                      // Item ID
        new PurchaseWithVirtualItem(        // Purchase type
            "currency_coin",                // Virtual item to pay with
            150)                            // Payment amount
    );

    // Pack of 5 shields that can be purchased for $2.99.
    public static VirtualGood 5_SHIELD_GOOD = new SingleUsePackVG(
        "5 Shields",                        // Name
	    "This is a 5-shield pack",          // Description
	    "shield_5",                         // Item ID
        new PurchaseWithMarket(             // Purchase type
            SHIELD_PACK_PRODUCT_ID,         // Product ID
            2.99)                           // Initial price
    );

    ...
}
```

### Initialization

``` cs

void Start () {

    // Add event listeners - Make sure to set the event handlers before you initialize
    HighwayEvents.OnGrowGiftingInitialized += OnGrowGiftingInitialized;
    HighwayEvents.OnGiftHandOutSuccess += OnGiftHandOutSuccess;
    HighwayEvents.OnGiftSendFinished += OnGiftSendFinished;

    // Initialize GrowHighway
    GrowHighway.Initialize();

    // Initialize GrowGifting
    GrowGifting.Initialize();

    SoomlaStore.Initialize(new ExampleAssets());
    SoomlaProfile.Initialize();

}

void OnGrowGiftingInitialized () {
    Debug.Log("GROW Gifting has been initialized.");
}

void OnGiftHandOutSuccess (Gift gift){
    // ... Show a nice animation of receiving the gift ...
}

void OnGiftSendFinished (Gift gift) {
    Debug.Log("Successfully sent " + gift.Payload.AssociatedItemId);
}

```
